Literata TT is a serif typeface created by the TypeTogether foundry as as the brand typeface for Google Play Books.
In 2020, it was released under the Open Font license.

This is a font-family declaration for the non-variable version of Literata TT as available from TypeTogetherâ€™s website <https://www.type-together.com/literata-font>.
The variable version and both versions from Google fonts <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata> are not supported.

Only two weights (regular and bold) currently work.
Support for the other weights (extralight, light, medium, semibold, extrabold and black) and some other OpenType features might be added in the future.
